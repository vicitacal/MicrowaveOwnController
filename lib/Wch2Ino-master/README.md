# WCH32 Arduino Compatibility Library

This library provides a set of functions and utilities to enhance compatibility between WCH32 microcontrollers and the Arduino ecosystem. It simplifies the development process by bridging the differences between the WCH32 platform and standard Arduino functions, enabling seamless integration and code portability.

## Features

- Arduino-style APIs for WCH32 microcontrollers.
- Simplified GPIO, PWM, and communication interfaces.
- Compatibility with popular Arduino libraries.
- Easy-to-use setup for WCH32 development boards.

## Getting Started

1. Install the library in your Arduino IDE or development environment.
2. Include the library in your project:
  ```cpp
  #include <WCH32ArduinoCompat.h>
  ```
3. Use the provided functions to write Arduino-compatible code for your WCH32 microcontroller.

## Supported Platforms

- WCH32 microcontrollers (e.g., CH32 series).

## License

This library is open-source and distributed under the MIT License.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve the library.
